# Have you heard about the myth that if you fold a paper enough times, you can reach the moon with it? Sure you do, but exactly how many? Maybe it's time to write a program to figure it out.

# You know that a piece of paper has a thickness of 0.0001m. Given distance in units of meters, calculate how many times you have to fold the paper to make the paper reach this distance.
# (If you're not familiar with the concept of folding a paper: Each fold doubles its total thickness.)

# Note: Of course you can't do half a fold. You should know what this means ;P

# Also, if somebody is giving you a negative distance, it's clearly bogus and you should yell at them by returning null (or whatever equivalent in your language. In Shell please return None).
